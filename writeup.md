## Abstract
As the mature of AI technology, there are more and more robots placed in the service industry. Although they can replace quite many labor works and can work consantly for you. 
Still many people prefer having the service from the real person. One of the reasons is because people like the good interation with the staffs and a good services from real 
person may make you feel like home. The robots are lack of a skill, which is distingusing human's emotion, whether the customer is happy or not happy. 
Although the robots service has been run for some years, but stil lack of the skill of telling  human's emotion from their facial expression.
This project is interestd in answering
Can we build a tool to identify the emotion from a person' facial expression using deep learning algorithm?
Possible use cases will be helpful in business cases in identify which customer is happy or not satisfied in the store, and adapt different manners to differn types of customers
