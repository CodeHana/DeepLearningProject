# Project Proposal - Face Expression Detection

#### Question/need:

- Can we build a tool to identif the emotion from a person' facial expression using deep learning algorithm?
- Possible use cases  will be helpful in business cases in identify which customer is happy or not satisfied in the store, and adapt different manners to differn types of customers

#### Data Description:

Dataset 
option1 (Annotate thermal face DB): https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-fully-annotated-thermal-face-database-and-its-for-Kopaczka-Kolk/fd809ee36fa6832dda57a0a2403b4b52c207549d
option2 (Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-with-deep-learning

#### Tools:

Deep learning algorithm - Keras
If time is enough, will try to work with Streamlit to deploy the model

#### MVP Goal:

Identify the person on image happy
